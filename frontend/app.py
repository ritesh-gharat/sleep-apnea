        ## What is Sleep Apnea?
        
        Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. 
        If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea.
        
        ### Main types of sleep apnea:
        
        1. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)**: The most common form that occurs when throat muscles relax
        2. **Central Sleep Apnea**: Occurs when your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing
        3. **Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome**: Occurs when someone has both obstructive and central sleep apnea
        
        ### How ECG helps detect Sleep Apnea:
        
        Sleep apnea episodes can cause changes in heart rhythm and rate. During an apnea event:
        - Heart rate may slow down
        - Heart rhythm may become irregular
        - After the event, heart rate often increases
        
        These patterns can be detected in ECG readings and form the basis of our analysis approach.

        - Loud snoring
        - Episodes of stopped breathing during sleep (reported by another person)
        - Gasping for air during sleep
        - Awakening with a dry mouth
        - Difficulty staying asleep (insomnia)
        - Frequent need to urinate at night

        - Depression or anxiety

        ### Therapies:
        - **CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)**: A machine delivers air pressure through a mask while you sleep
        - **Oral appliances**: Devices that keep your throat open by bringing your jaw forward
        - **Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)**: A device that learns your normal breathing pattern and stores the information
        
        ### Surgical options (when other treatments fail):
        - Tissue removal
        - Jaw repositioning
        - Implants
        - Nerve stimulation
        - Tracheostomy

    ## Our Mission
    
    Our mission is to provide accessible, preliminary screening for sleep apnea risk to encourage 
    earlier detection and treatment of this serious condition.
    
    ## How It Works
    
    This tool analyzes your ECG data along with personal health information to estimate your risk 
    of having sleep apnea. The analysis is based on machine learning algorithms trained on 
    thousands of ECG samples from both healthy individuals and those with confirmed sleep apnea.
    
    ## Important Disclaimer
    
    This tool provides a preliminary risk assessment and is not a substitute for professional 
    medical diagnosis. If you receive a moderate or high-risk result, please consult with a 
    healthcare professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis.
